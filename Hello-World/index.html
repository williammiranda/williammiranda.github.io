    Before joining the Startup Institute, I was a full time Audio Visual Technician for Presentation Services. While on my career path I got to work with top of the line A/V equipment such as projectors, audio mixing consoles, lighting boards, and video cameras. Working for Presentation Services was cool but it did not fulfilled my need to be creative, working with a team, and constantly learn.   

    I have an affinity for technology and have been learning about computers, gaming consoles, and software application since I was a kid. Once I started to learn how to code I knew this met my needs and now want to take the next step to become a UX/UI designer. The idea to work at a company with like minded people just excites me.   </p>
